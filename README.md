Well documented, extensively tested, and actively maintained.

## Overview

You can horizontally scale the Inference Gateway to handle multiple requests
from clients. The Inference Gateway will forward the requests to the respective
provider and return the response to the client.

**Note**: MCP middleware components can be easily toggled on/off via
environment variables (`MCP_ENABLED`) or bypassed per-request using headers
(`X-MCP-Bypass`), giving you full control over which capabilities are active.

**Note**: Vision/multimodal support is disabled by default for security and
performance. To enable image processing with vision-capable models (GPT-4o,
Claude 4.5, Gemini 2.5, etc.), set `ENABLE_VISION=true` in your environment
configuration.

The following diagram illustrates the flow:

<div align="center">

<img src="./assets/architecture.svg" width="950"
alt="Requests flow from clients through OIDC auth, MCP middleware and the
provider router to the LLM providers, with tokens streaming back" />

</div>

Client is sending:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a pirate."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello, world! How are you doing today?"
      }
    ],
  }'
```

\*\* Internally the request is proxied to OpenAI, the Inference Gateway inferring the provider by the model name.

You can also send the request explicitly using `?provider=openai` or any other supported provider in the URL.

Finally client receives:

```json
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "finish_reason": "stop",
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "content": "Ahoy, matey! 🏴‍☠️ The seas be wild, the sun be bright, and this here pirate be ready to conquer the day! What be yer business, landlubber? 🦜",
        "role": "assistant"
      }
    }
  ],
  "created": 1741821109,
  "id": "chatcmpl-dc24995a-7a6e-4d95-9ab3-279ed82080bb",
  "model": "N/A",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "usage": {
    "completion_tokens": 0,
    "prompt_tokens": 0,
    "total_tokens": 0
  }
}
```

For streaming the tokens simply add to the request body `stream: true`.

All `/v1` endpoints resolve the provider from the `provider/model` prefix, or
from an explicit `?provider=` query parameter.

Anthropic Messages API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/messages \
  -d '{
    "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"}]
  }'
```

Image generation (requires `ENABLE_IMAGES=true`):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/images/generations \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-image-1",
    "prompt": "A pirate ship sailing into a neon sunset",
    "n": 1,
    "size": "1024x1024"
  }'
```

Text to speech (requires `AUDIO_ENABLED=true`):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/audio/speech \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini-tts",
    "input": "Ahoy! Welcome aboard the Inference Gateway.",
    "voice": "alloy"
  }' -o speech.mp3
```

Local text to speech without any provider - the reserved `local/qwen3-tts`
model is synthesized by the gateway itself via llama.cpp's `llama-tts`
(one-shot, WAV output, supports `reference_audio` voice cloning). With
`AUDIO_LOCAL_AUTO_DOWNLOAD=true` (default) the binary and GGUF models are
fetched in the background at startup into the shared `~/.infer` cache
(`~/.infer/models/tts`, `~/.infer/bin`); requests answer `503` with
`Retry-After` until assets are ready:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/audio/speech \
  -d '{
    "model": "local/qwen3-tts",
    "input": "Ahoy! Welcome aboard the Inference Gateway."
  }' -o speech.wav
```

## Installation

> **Recommended**: For production deployments, running the Inference Gateway as
> a container is recommended. This provides better isolation, easier updates,
> and simplified configuration management. See [Docker](examples/docker-compose/)
> or [Kubernetes](examples/kubernetes/) deployment examples.
>
> **Kubernetes**: Deploy with the
> [Inference Gateway Operator](https://github.com/inference-gateway/operator),
> which reconciles a `Gateway` custom resource.

The Inference Gateway can also be installed as a standalone binary using the
provided install script or by downloading pre-built binaries from GitHub
releases.

### Using Install Script

The easiest way to install the Inference Gateway is using the automated install script:

**Install latest version:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inference-gateway/inference-gateway/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Install specific version:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inference-gateway/inference-gateway/main/install.sh | VERSION=v0.22.3 bash
```

**Install to custom directory:**

```bash
# Install to custom location
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inference-gateway/inference-gateway/main/install.sh | INSTALL_DIR=~/.local/bin bash

# Install to current directory
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inference-gateway/inference-gateway/main/install.sh | INSTALL_DIR=. bash
```

**What the script does:**

- Automatically detects your operating system (Linux/macOS) and architecture (x86_64/arm64/armv7)
- Downloads the appropriate binary from GitHub releases
- Extracts and installs to `/usr/local/bin` (or custom directory)
- Verifies the installation

> **Windows users**: The install script is a bash script and does not run on Windows
> natively. Download the Windows binary (`.zip`) directly from the
> [releases page](https://github.com/inference-gateway/inference-gateway/releases) instead.

**Supported platforms:**

- Linux: x86_64, arm64, armv7
- macOS (Darwin): x86_64 (Intel), arm64 (Apple Silicon)
- Windows: x86_64, arm64

### Manual Download

Download pre-built binaries directly from the [releases page](https://github.com/inference-gateway/inference-gateway/releases):

1. Download the appropriate archive for your platform
2. Extract the binary:

   ```bash
   tar -xzf inference-gateway_<OS>_<ARCH>.tar.gz
   ```

3. Move to a directory in your PATH:

   ```bash
   sudo mv inference-gateway /usr/local/bin/
   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/inference-gateway
   ```

### Verify Installation

```bash
inference-gateway --version
```

### Running the Gateway

Once installed, start the gateway with your configuration:

```bash
# Set required environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Start the gateway
inference-gateway
```

For detailed configuration options, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section below.

## Middleware Control and Bypass Mechanisms

The Inference Gateway uses middleware to process requests and add capabilities
like MCP (Model Context Protocol). Clients can control which middlewares are
active using bypass headers:

### Bypass Headers

- **`X-MCP-Bypass`**: Skip MCP middleware processing

### Client Control Examples

```bash
# Skip MCP middleware for direct provider access
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "X-MCP-Bypass: true" \
  -d '{
    "model": "groq/llama-3-8b",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Simple chat without tools"}]
  }'
```

### When to Use Bypass Headers

**For Performance:**

- Skip middleware processing when you don't need tool capabilities
- Reduce latency for simple chat interactions

**For Selective Features:**

- Use only standard tool calls (skip MCP): Add `X-MCP-Bypass: true`
- Direct provider access

**For Development:**

- Test middleware behavior in isolation
- Debug tool integration issues
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing applications

### How It Works Internally

The middlewares use these same headers to prevent infinite loops during their operation:

**MCP Processing:**

- When tools are detected in a response, the MCP agent makes up to 10 follow-up requests
- Each follow-up request includes `X-MCP-Bypass: true` to skip middleware re-processing
- This allows the agent to iterate without creating circular calls

> **Note**: These bypass headers only affect middleware processing. The core
> chat completions functionality remains available regardless of header values.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

Enable MCP to automatically provide tools to LLMs without requiring clients to
manage them:

```bash
# Enable MCP and connect to tool servers
export MCP_ENABLED=true
export MCP_SERVERS="http://filesystem-server:3001/mcp,http://search-server:3002/mcp"

# LLMs will automatically discover and use available tools
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-4",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "List files in the current directory"}]
  }'
```

The gateway automatically injects available tools into requests and handles tool
execution, making external capabilities seamlessly available to any LLM.

## Metrics and Observability

The Inference Gateway provides comprehensive OpenTelemetry metrics for
monitoring performance, usage, and function/tool call activity. Metrics are
automatically exported to Prometheus format and available on port 9464 by
default.

### Enabling Metrics

```bash
# Enable telemetry and set metrics port (default: 9464)
export TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true
export TELEMETRY_METRICS_PORT=9464

# Access metrics endpoint
curl http://localhost:9464/metrics
```

### Available Metrics

Metrics follow the [OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/).
Every series carries a `source` label: `gateway` for gateway-observed traffic, or a client-supplied value
(e.g. `claude-code-subscription`) for pushed metrics.

| Metric                                                | Type      | Description                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gen_ai_client_token_usage`                           | Histogram | Token usage; `gen_ai_token_type` is `input` or `output`                 |
| `gen_ai_server_request_duration_seconds`              | Histogram | End-to-end request duration in seconds; `error_type` set only on errors |
| `gen_ai_execute_tool_duration_seconds`                | Histogram | Tool execution duration in seconds (fed via the push endpoint)          |
| `gen_ai_client_operation_duration_seconds`            | Histogram | Client-side operation duration (push-only)                              |
| `gen_ai_client_operation_time_to_first_chunk_seconds` | Histogram | Time to first chunk (push-only)                                         |
| `gen_ai_server_time_to_first_token_seconds`           | Histogram | Time to first token (push-only)                                         |
| `inference_gateway_tool_calls_total`                  | Counter   | Total function/tool calls                                               |

**Common labels**: `gen_ai_provider_name`, `gen_ai_request_model`, `gen_ai_operation_name`, `source`;
tool metrics add `gen_ai_tool_type` and `gen_ai_tool_name`; token usage adds `gen_ai_token_type`;
`error_type` (HTTP status string) is present only on errors.

```promql
# Input tokens used by OpenAI models in the last hour
sum(increase(gen_ai_client_token_usage_sum{gen_ai_provider_name="openai", gen_ai_token_type="input"}[1h])) by (gen_ai_request_model)

# 95th percentile request latency by provider (seconds)
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(gen_ai_server_request_duration_seconds_bucket{gen_ai_provider_name=~"openai|anthropic"}[5m])) by (gen_ai_provider_name, le))

# Error rate percentage by provider
100 * sum(rate(gen_ai_server_request_duration_seconds_count{error_type!=""}[5m])) by (gen_ai_provider_name) / sum(rate(gen_ai_server_request_duration_seconds_count[5m])) by (gen_ai_provider_name)

# Most frequently used tools
topk(10, sum(increase(inference_gateway_tool_calls_total[1h])) by (gen_ai_tool_name))
```

### Pushing Metrics (OTLP)

Clients such as the infer CLI can push their own metrics (e.g. token usage from subscription-based sessions)
to the gateway. Enable the opt-in endpoint with `TELEMETRY_METRICS_PUSH_ENABLED=true` (alongside
`TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true`) and POST OTLP JSON to `POST /v1/metrics`; pushed series are exposed on the same
Prometheus endpoint with the client-supplied `source` label.
See [examples/docker-compose/monitoring](examples/docker-compose/monitoring/README.md) for a full example.

## Configuration

The Inference Gateway can be configured using environment variables. The
following [environment variables](./Configurations.md) are supported.

### Vision/Multimodal Support

To enable vision capabilities for processing images alongside text:

```bash
ENABLE_VISION=true
```

**Supported Providers with Vision:**

- OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-5, GPT-4.1, GPT-4 Turbo)
- Anthropic (Claude 3, Claude 4, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Claude 4.5 Haiku)
- Google (Gemini 2.5)
- Cohere (Command A Vision, Aya Vision)
- Ollama (LLaVA, Llama 4, Llama 3.2 Vision)
- Groq (vision models)
- Mistral (Pixtral)

**Note**: Vision support is disabled by default for performance and security
reasons. When disabled, requests with image content will be rejected even if the
model supports vision.

## Motivation

My motivation is to build AI Agents without being tied to a single vendor. By
avoiding vendor lock-in and supporting self-hosted LLMs from a single interface,
organizations gain both portability and data privacy. You can choose to consume
LLMs from a cloud provider or run them entirely offline with Ollama.
